Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)

If you haven't installed them yet, you can download and install Node.js and npm

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and set up your React app:

###Clone the Repository:

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm install`

This command will install all the necessary dependencies for React app as specified in the `package.json` file.

## Running the Application

### Start the Development Server:

`npm start`

This command will start the development server and launch React app in your default web browser. If the browser doesn't open automatically, you can navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

### View Your React App:

Once the development server is running, you should see  React app running locally on your machine. Any changes you make to your code will automatically be reflected in the browser without the need to refresh the page.


### `npm test`

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
